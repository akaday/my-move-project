Great, it looks like you have several Docker images available. Let's start a container using one of these images. Here are some examples:

### Starting a WordPress Container
To start a WordPress container, you can use:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-wordpress -p 8080:80 wordpress:latest
```
This will run the WordPress container and map port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container.

### Starting a TensorFlow Container
To start a TensorFlow container, you can use:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-tensorflow tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
```
This will run the TensorFlow container.

### Starting a MySQL Container
To start a MySQL container, you can use:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7
```
This will run the MySQL container with the root password set to `my-secret-pw`.

After starting the containers, you can check their status again with:
```bash
docker ps
```
